# Lava Walker

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.11 that adds the **Lava Walker** enchantment.

## Features

**Lava Walker** works like Frost Walker, but for lava - walk across lava lakes by turning lava source blocks into cobblestone beneath your feet.

- Enchantment for boots
- Converts lava source blocks to cobblestone when walking nearby
- Small 2-block radius for balance
- Cobblestone is permanent (unlike Frost Walker's ice)
- Treasure enchantment (found in loot, not enchanting table)
- Mutually exclusive with Frost Walker and Depth Strider
